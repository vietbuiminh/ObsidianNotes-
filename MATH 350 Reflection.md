>**Weekly Reflection**
The four course objectives are listed below. For your weekly reflection please identify the objective you have made the most progress on this week and describe what aspect of the class allowed you to make that gain.

For the first week of the course, I have made the most progress in "learning to apply course material to improve thinking, problem solving, and decisions." The group works, and presentation in class have given me the most to improve my problem solvings and decisions. Taken from the Pythagorean Theorem exercise, my group chose Euclidean solution to prove the Pythagorean Theorem, which was relatively complicated to derive at first. However, after a couple of minutes and hint from Dr. Rodman our group has the key to solve the problem. Personally, I wasn't understanding the hint at the begining but after an hour sitting in the library and saw the problem in a different perspective. I can use the hint to apply for other right triangles within the geometry. The full the solution clicked in me during that time, I even used the online graphing tool to make the sketch so I can organize it into a Google slides to present for my groupmates. I would say I also gained the skills in expressing myself orally or in writing. Notably I also want to mention that I have the same improve on "Gaining a basis understanding of the subject (factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories)" because the presentations from many group give me a better understand on 3 different ways to solve the same problem and even a better understand on a fast / slow solution.
