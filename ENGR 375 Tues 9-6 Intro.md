# Your Design
- Communication - typically last step
- In your presentation - 
	- Pictures - large enough for everyone in the room to see
		- Use label and arrow to point out features
	- Dont include something you can't explain in the presentation
	- Be clear in conclusion 
	- Be honest
	- Anticipate Q's

# DFM + DFA
- fewer parts
- parts that work across multiple products
- features can be manufactured
- use self fasters - snaps rather than screws (keep an eye if the snap can survive *More points on Page 21*)
