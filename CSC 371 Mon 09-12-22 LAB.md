## Q1:
Big O is the upper bound of algorithm runtime, as data gets larger.
A program with larger $\Theta$ runs slower than a program with a smaller $\Theta$ 
Big $\Omega$ describe the lower bound of the runtime. 
In short, $\omega <= \Omega <= \Theta <= O <= o$ 
## Q2
- A. 
	- $O(n^2)$ Because there are two nested loops that both run n times
- B. 
	- $O(m*n*p)$ 
	- as m, n q approach infinity: $O(N^3)$ 
- C. $O(n^2)$ if we only focus on the largest n factor but in complete $O(n^2 - n)$ 
## Q3:
```python
for i in range(2, 100):
    check = True
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            check = False
    if check:
        print(i)
```
Complexity: $O(n^2)$

Improved algo:
```python
i = 2
while i < 100:
    if i == 2:
        i += 1
        print(i)
    elif i > 2 and i % 2 != 0:
        check = True
        for j in range(2, int(i/2) + 1):
            if i % j == 0:
                check = False
        if check:
            print(i)
    i += 2
    
```
Complexity: $O(n(n/2)

In order to make the algorithm more efficent, we would check the if the number is divisible by any other prime number we found first, then run it through the loop, only checking numbers that are not prime. O(log(n))
