# Theorem 2.5
Claim: Given non empty set $\mathbb{M} \subseteq \mathbb{L}$, $\mathbb{M}$ subspace of $\mathbb{L}$ <=> $\mathbb{M}$ closed under addition and M closed under scalar multiplcation

Assume: non empty set $\mathbb{M}$ subspace of $\mathbb{L}$
W.M.S. $\mathbb{M}$ closed under addition and $\mathbb{M}$ closed under scalar multiplication
$\mathbb{M}$ subspace of $\mathbb{L}$ => $\mathbb{M} \subseteq \mathbb{L}$ and $\mathbb{M}$ closed under addition and $\mathbb{M}$ is closed under scalar mulitplication (definition 2.5.1)

Assume: $\mathbb{M}$ closed under addition and $\mathbb{M}$ closed under scalar multiplication
W.M.S. non empty set $M \subseteq L$, $\mathbb{M}$ subspace of $\mathbb{L}$
Within axiom 1 -> 7
$\forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}, P,Q,R \in \mathbb{M}$ since $\mathbb{M} \subseteq \mathbb{L}$ => $P,Q,R \in \mathbb{L}$ 
Let $S \in \mathbb{M}$ 
$S + \bar{0} = S \in \mathbb{L}$ because $\bar{0}$ is also in $\mathbb{L}$ and $\mathbb{M}$ closed under addition 
Therefore S always has something it it and $S \in M$, $\bar{0} \in M$
=> $\exists \bar{0}: S + \bar{0} = S$ (axiom 6)
=> $\mathbb{M} \neq \emptyset => \exists S \in \mathbb{M} => S \in \mathbb{L}$ 
=> fully sastifies axiom 1 -> 7
=> $\mathbb{M}$ is a non empty set $M \subseteq \mathbb{L}$, $\mathbb{M}$ subspace of $\mathbb{L}$

=>  non empty set $\mathbb{M} \subseteq \mathbb{L}$, $\mathbb{M}$ subspace of $\mathbb{L}$ <=> $\mathbb{M}$ closed under addition and M closed under scalar multiplcation
