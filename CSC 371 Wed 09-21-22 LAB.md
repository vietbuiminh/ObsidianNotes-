Q1
Selection sort works best for such cases: the space is limited, and it is much more stable than other sorting algorithms, and it is in-place. Such as we have a short array that needs to be sorted out with limited space selection. The worst case for selection sort if the array is extremely long and the runtime will take up to $O(N^2)$.
For the best case runtime, the Insertion sort would be better in the best case runtime as it will run with in $O(N)$, the average runtime, the worst case runtime, space, stable, in-place are the same with Selection sort.
Unlike the prior two sorting algorithms, Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. This means it breaks the problem up into smaller pieces and then solves it individually. Merge sort is a very fast algorithm, running in at $O(nlogn)$ for best, worst, and average run time. The downside of merge sort is that it utilizes extra space, so its space complexity is no longer O(1). If you have the extra space and want a faster algorithm, merge is a good choice.
Quick sort works in a similar fashion to merge sort. It is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides an array into smaller subarrays using an arbitrary ‘pivot point.’ The difference between merge sort and quick sort is that quick sort does not use extra space. They do differ in time complexity slightly. The best and average runtime for the two is O(nlogn), but the worst case for quicksort is O(n^2), where merge sort’s worst runtime remains O(nlogn).
Heap sort is implemented differently than the other algorithms. It is a sorting technique that is based on the binary heap data structure. Heap sort is a very fast algorithm, clocking in at O(nlogn) for its runtime in best case, average, and worst. It also does not use any extra space, so its space complexity is O(1). Heap sort seems to outperform all of its contemporaries in time complexity and it is also an in-place algorithm.

Q2:
```python
def heapify(arr, n, i):
    smallest = i
    l = 2 * i + 1
    r = 2 * i + 2
    
    if l < n and arr[smallest] > arr[l]:
        smallest = l
    
    if r < n and arr[smallest] > arr[r]:
        smallest = r
    
    if smallest != i:
        arr[i], arr[smallest] = arr[smallest], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, n, smallest)


def findKMax(arr, k):
    if k > len(arr):
        print("k is larger than number of element in the array")
    else:
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n//2 - 1, -1, -1):
            heapify(arr, n, i)
        for i in range(n-1, 0,-1):
            arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i] #swap
            heapify(arr, i, 0)
        for i in range(0,k):
            print(arr[i])

arr = [3, 27, 12, 9, 35, 2, 70]
k= 3
findKMax(arr, 3)
```
The complexity of our program worst, best, average runtime is O(nlogn).
