# Complexity Analysis

## The Challenge
Will the program be able to solve a large partical input?
- Time issue
- Run out of memory

Commonly used notation
- big theta
- big o: talk about meaningful way about the code without counting all the operation!
- big omega

>We can say this algo is asymptotically faster than other to describe the fastest algo

```python
#Binary search
def bsearch(a, target, low, high):
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) mod 2
        if a[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif a[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1


arr = []
n = int(input("Enter number of elements : "))
for i in range(0, n):
    x = int(input())
    arr.append(x) 
      
print(arr)
arr.sort()
print(arr)

for i in range(0, len(arr) - 2):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(arr) - 1):
        val = bsearch(arr, -(arr[i] + arr[j]), 0, n)
        if val != -1:
            print(arr[i], arr[j], arr[val])
