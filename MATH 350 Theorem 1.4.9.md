## Theorem 1.4.9

Let: $\sigma$ and $\tau$ be 2 bases for $\mathbb{R}^3$
Let $v = (v_1,v_2,v_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ 
W.M.S:  The function that maps $[v]_\sigma$ to $[v]_\tau$ is well-defined, 1-1, and onto.
Proof:
- W.M.S The function is well-defined
	Assume function is not well-defined that we have a point in the list of coefficient of $\sigma$  can be not be described in $\tau$
	but because $\tau$ is a basis 
	==> it is spans in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
	==> linearly independent, which also mean that there is no point in $\sigma$ describe more than a point in $\tau$ 
	=><= 
	Also assume a point in the list of coefficient can be describe in $\tau$ and not $\sigma$ 
	we do the same thing like above $\sigma$ is a basis means, it spans in $\mathbb{R}^3$ , and linearly independent, which also mean that there is no point in $\tau$ describe more than a point in $\sigma$ 
==> Function is well defined
- W.M.S the function is 1-1
	Assume function is not 1-1 and that means we have more than a point in the list of coefficient of $\sigma$ can be describe a point in $\tau$ 
	But we know two lists are linear independent (from the definition of basis) so there are no more than a point possible in $\sigma$ could describe one point on $\tau$.
	=><=
	=> function is 1-1
- W.M.S: the function is onto
	Assume function is not onto means there is a point not from list of coefficient $\sigma$ describes a point in $\tau$ 
	but 
	$\tau$ basis ==> $\tau$ spans $\mathbb{R}^3$
	$\sigma$ spans $\mathbb{R}^3$ means there is every point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be describe $\tau$ from using $\sigma$ 
=> function is onto
