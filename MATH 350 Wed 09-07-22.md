### Note
- Presentation during Office Hour every week (or biweekly)
- Will get zero if not presentation after 2 weeks
- Presentation will be about one of the past 3 theorms in class using the presentation day as the benchmark
- Writing reflection every the end of the week
	- Every Monday at 5 o'clock
	- Could do it at 10 at noon every Friday and think about what I have learned in the week.

# GRADING POLICY 
There will be 500 points possible. Earning 90% will guarantee an A, 80% will guarantee a B, and 70% a C. Being in the top/bottom ~3% will add a +/- to your grade.
- Problems Before each class day you will practice working with new ideas and definitions by doing online problems using WeBWorK. The practice problems allow you to do variations on each problem as many times as you like before doing the final problems where you submit your answer for credit. Each set is worth 3 points. (35x3pts). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 105pts.
- **Theorem Write-ups** The main work in the course will be preparing well organized and typed proofs for each of the Theorems in our packets. These proofs will be worth 5 points each. You will turn these in on Moodle with no late assignments accepted. You will have the opportunity to redo them for up to 50% of the points lost. This way if you don’t turn in a theorem you can earn 50% instead of 0%. If you get 4/5 = 80% and do corrections that can become 90% (35x5pts). Submit your corrections on Moodle within 1 week of when they are returned. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 175pts.
- **Presentations** You will need to make one complete proof presentation to me weeks 2-13. You will have ±1 week of flexibility on these. In other words you can do your presentation for a given week 1 week early or 1 week late. Each presentation is worth 5 points. You will get 5 points if you make it through without my help and can answer any questions I ask during your presentation, you will get 4 points if you need a gentle nudge from me, or can’t completely answer a question about your proof. If you can’t make it through the proof you get 0, but time permitting, you can try again within the time allowed for that week’s presentation. If your group presents in class you may use that score. (12x5pts). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60pts.
- **Reflections** Each week you will reflect on your progress toward the goals of this class in a 3 point Moodle quiz. Each week's entry must include the course goal you think you have made the most progress on that week and identify the theorem or exercise where you demonstrated that gain. There will be a final reflection during finals week worth 8pts . . 50pts.
- **Final Exams** The final exam will be cumulative, with problems and proofs similar to those you will have done throughout the term. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 110pts.
