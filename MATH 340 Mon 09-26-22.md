Example: Maximize $25x_1 + 30x_2$ subject to
				$20x_1 + 30x_2 <= 690$
				$5x_1 + 4x_2 <= 120$
				$x_1, x_2 > 0$
Use slack variable:
				$20x_1 + 30x_2 + y_1 = 690$
				$5x_1 + 4x_2 +y_2 = 120$
				$x_1, x_2, y1_, y_2 >= 0$
			{x1, x2, y1, y2}
Ex: Set x1 = x2 = 0
y1 = 690, y2 = 12-
Feasible
Set x1 = y1 = 0
30x2 = 690
2x2 + y2 = 120
x2 = 23
y2 = 28
Feasible (0,23)
x1=y2 = 0

30x2 + y1 = 690
4x2 = 120
x2 = 30. y1=690 -900
=-210 < 0
(0,30) not feasible

(34.5,0) infeasible
(24,0) feasible
(12,15) feasible

Example: We need three 2D planes to intersect at a point.
Set groups of three of the variables = 0
Computational Complexity
Q: How many choices do we have?
m = number of decision variables
n = nonneg constraints
For each nonegative constraint gi(x) <= bi, add one slack variable yi
gi(x) + yi = bi
variables are
{x1, x2, x3,.. xm, y1, y2, y3, yn}
 Decision            slack vars
 choose m variables out of the m+n total variables
 (m+n)
 m = (m+n)!/m!n!
 # of possible extreme points
Ex: m=2 decision varibles
n =2 slack varibles
(4 = 4!/2!2! = 4.3.2 = 12/2 = 6
2)                       2.2
Ex: m=11, n=5
16!/5!11! = 4,368

let $x_1$ is factory 
$x_2$ is warehouse
