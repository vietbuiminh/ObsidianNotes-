Ex: An extreme point (corner point) of a convec set is a boundary point that is the intersection of boundary segments.

Note: If an optimal solution to a linear program exists, it must occur at an extreme point
Ex: Feasible region = R^2 Maximize x1+x2)

Ex: x1 <= 3
x1 >= 5
feasible region is empty set

Thm: Suppose the feasible region of linear program is 
1) non empty
2) bounded
3) convex
the objective function attains a max and min value

Def: A level curve of the objective function is the curve
f(x) = c
c is a constant

# 7.3 Algebraic Solutions
Note: The previous examples suggest a procedure to find an optimal solution for a linear program.
Assume the feasible region is bounded none empty, convex. 
1. Find all the intersection points of the constraints.
2. Determind which are the extreme points
3. Evaluate the objective function at all the extreme points.
Ex: Maximize $25x_1+30x_2$ subject to 
$20x_1+30x_2 <= 690$
$5x_1+4x_2 <=120$
$x_1,x_2 >=0$

Introduce the slack variable y1,y2
$20x_1+30x_2 + y_1 = 690$
$5x_1+4x_2 +y_2=120$
$x_1,x_2, y_1, y_2 >=0$

Say y1< 0
$20x_1+30x_2=690-y_1 >690$
Slack variable cannot be negative!

What do the slack variable represent?
If y1= 0 => $20x_1+30x_2 = 690$
We are on the boundary!

Ex: f(x) = 20x1+20x2
