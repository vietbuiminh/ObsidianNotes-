### Goals
- Design and Analysis

---
Homework:
- Reading: Algo, Chap 1.4 and other materials mentioned in the rederences
- Brainstorming: How can we reduce the array access for 3-sum problem
- Coding: try to solve 4-sum problem and implement in Java/Python
---
# Fundamentals
## Where we are?
- Data structure
- Java/ Python
- pseudocode
- Math

>**Algo**: step by step procedure of solving a problem

### Guiding Question
- Does it work?
- Is it fast?
- Can I do better?

## Brute Force Approach
>A very general problem-solving technique that consists of sustematically enumerating all possible candidate to satisfy the problem 

3 Sum Problem: 
|2|3|0|5|-2|-3|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|3|0|-3|
|2|0|-2|
|5|-2|-3|

Input: -8 -7 5 2
Sequence:
- -8 -7 5
- -8 -7 2
- -8 5 2
**- *-7 5 2***

Complexity: 3 loops = $N^3$

$\frac{(N*(N-1)*(N-2))}{3!} = \frac{1}{6} N^3$
